### Hi!

I'm João.
I work as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning and robotics at [IAS - TU Darmstadt](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Main/LandingPage?from=Main.HomePage).
- 🎓 I got my Ph.D. in robot learning from [IAS - TU Darmstadt](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Main/LandingPage?from=Main.HomePage).
- 🔭 I work on embedding robots with learning algorithms to make them more capable of solving new tasks in the real world.
- 📚 My research interests lie in machine learning and reinforcement learning applied to robot manipulation.
